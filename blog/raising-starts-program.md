## Partnership with Raising Starts Program

The PuzzlesCloud Team has been selected to participate in the Raising Starts program designed to support startups in the earliest development stages, which with the support of the Government of Switzerland implements the Science Technology Park Belgrade. Through work with
mentors, training and comprehensive professional support, the Program will enable us to acquire knowledge and
skills to accelerate the development of our innovation, open the doors of the global market and reach new potential
investors.

The program is implemented within the project "Technopark-Serbia 2 - Encouraging exports through the development of technological
parks‚Äù, by which the Government of Switzerland supports the further development of innovations and expansion of the network of technology parks, conducted by the Science and Technology Park Belgrade.
