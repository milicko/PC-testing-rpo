# Formatted Text Examples
Below is an illustration of the Format toolbar used to format text:
___

Here are some examples of the effects different options have on text:

## Font buttons:
As well as the standard Font drop down box showing a list of all the fonts on your system and the **Point** size box that allows you to set the font size,\
two shortcut buttons have been added that allow you to increase the selected text or group of text objects at the press of a button:


![1](http://www.digitalworkshop.co.uk/support/help/image/Icon_Text_Increase.jpg) Will increase the font size by 2 points every time you press the button.

![2](http://www.digitalworkshop.co.uk/support/help/image/Icon_Text_Decrease.jpg) Will decrease the font size by 2 points every time you press the button.

## Text Format:
**The standard text format options are also available for text i.e. bold, italic, underline and outline:**

![4](http://www.digitalworkshop.co.uk/support/help/image/Icon_Text_Italic.jpg)   <img src="http://www.digitalworkshop.co.uk/support/help/image/Icon_Text_Example_Italic.jpg" width="30" height="15" />

![5](http://www.digitalworkshop.co.uk/support/help/image/Icon_Text_Underline.jpg)   <img src="http://www.digitalworkshop.co.uk/support/help/image/Icon_Text_Example_Underline.jpg" width="30" height="15" />

![6](http://www.digitalworkshop.co.uk/support/help/image/Icon_Text_Outline.jpg)   <img src="http://www.digitalworkshop.co.uk/support/help/image/Icon_Text_Example_Outline.jpg" width="30" height="15" />

>Note:\
**You can combine any of these formats together, as in the last example above which is a combination of the bold, underline and outline formats.**

## Text Justification:
* Text can be aligned to the 
  - left,
  - right, 
  - centre
    
+ or one of the three full justifications: Full Justification, Density Justification and Aspect Justification.

`Note:`\
`The Full justification spreads the words across the page but does not change the size of them. The Density Justification also spreads the words and does not change their size but puts spaces between the characters in a word. The Aspect Justification spreads the words but stretches the words to fill the space as well.`

The Density and Aspect methods can provide some visually interesting effects.

## I just have to store some code here, if you don't mind

### I'll put it here

**LoGiC _iS_ rEaL**  _!!!_

```java
if(a == 0){   
  a = 0;
}
```

### And also here
**It's getting better**
```java
if (false == true) {
  // log some message
}
```

### You know the process...

---
I'll just assert and finish this...

```java
public void justAssert(){
    boolean checkTrue = true;
    Assert.assertTrue(checkTrue);
}

//let me return true he he

public boolean trueStatement(){
    return true;    
}
```
