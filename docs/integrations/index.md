## Integration with Git Repositories

In order to import one of your projects to our App, you would need to keep your cool projects in one of the supported Git service providers. 

Currently we support the following Git providers:

1. GitHub
2. GitLab
3. Azure DevOps
4. Atlassian (Bitbucket)

But no worries, we are working hard to support the others as well. Stay tuned. 

## Integration with OAuth Providers

We want your user experience on the top level. You don't need to remember many passwords any more. It is enough to register and login with one of the supported authentication providers. 

Currently we support the following OAuth providers:

1. Google
2. GitHub
3. GitLab
