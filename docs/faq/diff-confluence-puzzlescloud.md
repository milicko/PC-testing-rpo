Confluence is a wiki based documentation service for enterprises. As such, it does not practice docs-as-code principle and has very limited version control capabilities. On the other hand, Git is the heart of the PuzzlesCloud solution and as such provides very powerful versioning capabilities and workflows. Both have options to leverage document templates, while PuzzlesCloud bases its templating concept on docx corporate templates, providing a highly professional look of the published documents. 

The PuzzlesCloud Team is working on enriching the available document templates for many different purposes and use cases. Please stay tuned.
